# ruby-mastermind-game

Objective:
---------------------------
Continue building on Ruby Programming skills by building Mastermind game in the Terminal utilsiing OOP methods (classes and modules). 

Instructions:
---------------------------
- The Mastermind game involves the player creating or guessing the secret code against either another player, or for this project a computer. 

Rules:
---------------------------
Main Rules:
- If the exact color is matched in the correct position, this is tallied as 'match.' If only the correct color is gussed (incorrect position), then 'partial' is tallied.
- If there is a duplicate color in the guess, it is not counted as a 'match' tally unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colors in the hidden code.
- To win, the colors must be guessed correctly in the correct order (i.e. 'match' = 4) within 12 turns. 

Player is guessor:
-  Player must select from six unique colors a total of four times, to guess the 4 colors in the correct order, i.e. the 'code.'
- Tip: A common strategy is the guess the same color four times at the first go, to immedietely assess a 'match' or 'partial' match. 

Player is (code) creator:
- Player must select from six unique colors a total of four times to create the code. 
- The computer randomly selects the from the choice of six colors. If there is a match, the computer remembers the color and position and moves onto the remaining unknown part of the code. 

Fundementals Employed:
---------------------------
- Basic Ruby: Methods, Arrays, hashes, methods, Loops, Enumerables, Conditional Logics, Debugging, IRB.

- Best Practises: OOP involving classes and modules.     

What I learnt:
---------------------------
- Further practise of Basic Ruby fundementals and proving further proving problem solving to create a complete Mastermind game.  
- Exposure and appreciation of OOP practises.
